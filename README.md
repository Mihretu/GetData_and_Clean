 Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

This is the file for the course on getting data and cleaning. 
The data is obtained from the website http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones on 
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
As described on the website the data is the result of an experiment with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

For this project different files ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4422340/128417494-e25e4047-4c1b-487a-86ad-b5a3fd72d603.png)
in an tidy format provided. The task is to clean these files and merge and give appropriate labels that a human being can understand.

I read the test data (both x and y) and train datasets (y and x). The consistecy interms of the number of columns and rows have been chcked before the binding of these datasets on column and row basis.

The script that performed this task and the final clean dataset is attached to thsi project.
